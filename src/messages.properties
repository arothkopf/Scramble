help.message.heading = Scramble - Image Scrambling Software
help.message.intro = Scramble provides basic information security by rendering images unreadable via a reversible process.\nA password is used to prevent others from unscrambling the image. 
help.message.load = There is currently no image loaded.  \nYou may load an image by selecting "Open an image file" in the File menu.  \nThis program can read files in 3 formats: GIF, JPEG and PNG 
help.message.scramble_or_unscramble = There is currently a loaded image.\n  \nIf it's scrambled, you may unscramble it by selecting "Unscramble the image" from the Image menu (and \nyou will be asked for the password with which it was scrambled).\nIf you give an incorrect password, the unscrambling will proceed anyway, but the resulting image will still be unreadable. \n \nIf it's not scrambled, you may scramble it by selecting "Scramble the image" \nfrom the Image menu (and you will be asked to give a password).
help.message.save.scrambled = There is currently a scrambled image.  \nYou may save it as a PNG file (scrambled images must be saved in a lossless format, so you may not save it as a GIF \nor JPEG file) by selecting "Save" from the File menu. 
help.message.save.unscrambled = There is currently an unscrambled image.  \nYou may save it as a GIF, JPEG or PNG file by selecting "Save the image" from the File menu. To specify the format, \nadd the desired format's file extension to the name of the file in the file dialog (e.g. \n"myfile.gif" will be saved as a GIF file, "myfile.jpg" will be saved as a JPEG).
help.message.done = You have successfully saved an image.  \nYou may load another by selecting "Open an image file" in the File menu or \nre-save the file with different parameters by selecting "Save the image" \nfrom the File menu.
